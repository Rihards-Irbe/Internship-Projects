## Internship Description
During my whole month internship in edy365 I gained hands on experience working with APIs, enhancing my skills in frontend and backend development. Also strenghtened my understanding of how to work with databases. This opportunity allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge gained from my school lessons in real world projects and improve my problem solving abilities in a professional environment. I also learned how to automate website testing using Chrome DevTools Recorder, a tool that allows you to either write a test script or record user interactions that can be replayed to streamline the testing process.

### Technologies Used  
- Languages: PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Tools: Postman, Notepad++
- APIs: OpenWeatherMap API
- Database: MySQL
